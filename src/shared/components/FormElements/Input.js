import React, {useReducer, useEffect}from 'react';
//Use reducer allows you to manage state in a component and give a function that can be call which updates the state and re-renders the component, can manage more complex state than with use state
// useEffect allows to run some logic when the dependencies changes.It adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes.
